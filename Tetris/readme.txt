To make it easier to determine collisions and such, the position of a box is based on an x and y pos, which are then multiplied by the size of the box when drawn.
    This means can simply check within a 2d list to see if there are any collisions.
    
Unlike tic tac toe, does not use a 1d list to store the information because it is simpler (in this specific game) to use a 2d list.
