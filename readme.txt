For these games to work, you must have pygame installed.

To run the complete program, run the file main.py in this directory with ipython3 (or however you run using pygame)
    The reason why all of the subdirectories use import directory.x as x is to make it eaiser to convert to running the game individually
    
To run an individual game, checkout the branch ____, and run the file main.py in the wanted games subdirectory.

For the imports, the reason why all files simply include button is because all of the code for the button is the same.
    This is different than the other menus and such, which are all different and thus should not be shared.
    
    Furthermore, to increase the ease of running the games individually, the code is simply common throughout the games
