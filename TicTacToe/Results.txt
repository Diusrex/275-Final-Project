Some results of me playing against the AI (and testing it). Was mostly curious how the positive would perform

The players will be listed in the order that they will play (Me vs positive means I'm the first player, positive is the second player)

The player positive is the AI that used SemiRandomPicker to decide its current move (based on score), rather than max
The player best is the AI that uses max to decide its current move (based on score), rather than SemiRandomPicker

Me vs positive:
    me: 1
    positive: 7
    tie: 2
    
Pick from positive vs pick best:
    positive: 5
    best: 8
    ties: 1

best vs best:
    first player only wins (same calculations every time)

best vs positive:
    best: 2
    positive: 2
    ties: 1
