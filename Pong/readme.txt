The flow of this program is as follows:
    
  
The ball can start travelling in any direction, but it's total speed will always be the same.
Also, the ball will minorly speed up every time it hits a paddle up to a certain point.
    The x and y speed will be increased at random, so it's angle may change

The paddle max speeds are very arbitrary, and could likely be adjusted for a better user experience. (same with the ball)
